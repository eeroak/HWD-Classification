# HWD-Classification
## MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification  

This repository is an implementation of classifier on MNIST dataset with PyTorch.  

## Process
1. Load and visualize the data  
2. Train the MultilayerPerceptron -model  
3. Evaluate the performance of our trained model on a test dataset!

## Notes and what i learned  
I understand the concept of training a ML-model from "scratch" a bit better, babyproofing it for myself by commenting everything in the code so i can actually learn something.  
The project was really interesting and sparked a new interest for me in the field of ML & AI, as i was more of a data oriented person before.  
My model performed well, since PyTorch is pretty straight forward but i have never used it before this so it was nice and fun to tinker around with.  
But now, i understand optimizers and how training a model for something "bigger" actually works.

## Improvements and problems  
My main problem with this project in particular was the data handling and fitting it correctly in every place.  
Also i mainly coded this project on my laptop, which is not nearly as powerful as my home pc so the training times were really slow.  
Next time i could improve on handling the data correctly and formatting it correctly straight away.
