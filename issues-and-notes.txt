Just a file for me to keep track of what i had issues with during this project.

ISSUES
Data loading issues, folder structure might be scuffed.
Had an issue with the batch shape after flattening, turns out my sample size was too great to fit nicely, so i had to tone it down.
Another issue with the data shape, matrices were different sizes so no multiplications could be performed.

NOTES
The pixels in the 28X28 handwritten digit image are flattened to form an array of 784-pixel values, so basically decompressing a 2D-array into one dimension.
